But is that reputation really justified? Starting in 1911, a year which saw a warship on the Mersey suppressing near revolution in the Liverpool Transport Strike, the remarkable exhibition of paintings by Picasso, Matisse, C\'ezanne and the European avant-garde alongside works by local artists at the Bluecoat, and the opening of The Liver Building, the first major building in the UK to use reinforced concrete in its construction and crowned by two liver birds that came to symbolise the city's resilience, this fascinating book looks at one hundred years of radicals and radicalism in Liverpool. Ranging widely across a century of politics, music, football, theatre, architecture and art, Liverpool: City of Radicals concludes with a look at the contemporary city and asks what role radicalism can play in the future of Liverpool."--Publisher's website.},

  abstract = {This article focuses upon the local cultures of Liverpool and Belfast, two cities wracked by recurrent communal sectarian strife. My analysis contributes to a growing appreciation of the locality and region as sites of accommodation, negotiation, and resistance to ``nationalizing forces.'' I argue that in Liverpool secularization and democratization contributed to local Tory Democracy's loss of control over popular sectarianism and to the subsequent development of a dynamic working-class movement that generated sustained Protestant-Catholic violence. In contrast, Ulster Unionism largely contained and controlled sectarian violence in Belfast. With the national threat of Irish Home Rule, the movement intervened, drawing Protestant working-class activity away from the street into ``representative'' structures, which were designed to harness and ``police'' popular sectarianism. Consequently, I examine whether the growing nationalization of British political culture from 1880 to the 1920s exacerbated or contributed to the resolution of entrenched sectarian strife within the two cities.},
